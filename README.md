# SASSE Akademiska 2013

This is an experimental project to modernize the [SASSE Akademiska](http://sasse.se/akademiska) site. The main aims are:

* Facilitate easy content sharing by integrating with the Dropbox API.
* Provide Wiki functionality to allow general articles on academic topics at SSE.
* Leverage [Mozilla Persona](http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/persona/) for authentication (this is the future for authentication in SASSE and, indeed, the web).

We'll see how far we get.

The project is created using Node and Express.
